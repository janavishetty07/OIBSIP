## Unemployment Analysis in India using Python ##

This project is part of my data science internship, where I explored **unemployment trends across India** using real-world data. The goal was to understand how unemployment changed across **states, regions, and over time**, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

I used Python and popular data visualization tools to analyze patterns, compare trends, and present insights using both static and interactive visualizations.


 ðŸ“Œ Objective

To analyze unemployment rates across Indian states and regions from 2019 to 2021, with a special focus on the pandemic year (2020). The project aims to identify regions most affected by unemployment and explore relationships between employment, labour participation, and joblessness.


 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas â€“ for handling and analyzing data
- Matplotlib and Seaborn â€“ for data visualization
- Plotly Express â€“ for interactive charts and plots
- Jupyter Notebook â€“ for writing and running the analysis


ðŸ“Š What I Did in This Project

1. Loaded and Cleaned the Data
   - Renamed confusing column names for clarity
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted date columns into proper datetime format

2. Explored State-wise Trends
   - Plotted unemployment rates over time for each state
   - Identified and focused on the top 3 states with the highest unemployment
   - Analyzed data specifically for the year 2020

3. Analyzed Regional Patterns
   - Compared unemployment trends across regions of India
   - Created heatmaps to show changes over time by region

4. Compared and Correlated Variables
   - Used a bar plot to compare average unemployment by state
   - Built a correlation matrix to see relationships between unemployment, employment, and labour force participation

5. Created Interactive Visualizations
   - Designed an interactive bubble chart to explore unemployment rates over time
   - Used pair plots to show how multiple variables relate to each other


ðŸ§¾ About the Dataset

The dataset contains:
- Names of Indian states and regions  
- Unemployment rate (estimated)  
- Estimated number of employed people  
- Labour force participation rate  
- Time-series data from 2019â€“2021  


ðŸ“ˆ Sample Visualizations

- Line plots showing how unemployment changed in each state
- Bar charts ranking states by average unemployment
- Heatmaps to spot high-unemployment periods by region
- Correlation heatmap of employment-related factors
- Interactive scatter plot using Plotly


 ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Some states and regions were consistently hit harder by unemployment
- The year 2020 saw a sharp spike in unemployment across the country
- There's a clear negative correlation between the number of employed people and the unemployment rate
- Labour force participation also impacts unemployment in many regions.

  Conclusion
  
  The analysis revealed how unemployment rates significantly fluctuated during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and highlighted which states and regions were most affected.
  Interactive and comparative visualizations helped uncover correlations between employment, labour participation, and unemployment rates.
